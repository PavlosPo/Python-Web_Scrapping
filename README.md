webscrapping.ipynb :

It uses a job posting website, to scrap the job posts, save them in a .txt file with their links to the job post.
It also filters out the one month and more time period of the job that had been posted.

It is my inital attempt to webscrapping, used the Amazon.com website to search for the price of a relevant product.
It also saves the results every x period of time, as a DataSet.
